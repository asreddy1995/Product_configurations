# Product_configurations
Motivation
The aim of the project is multi-class text classification to make-up products based on their description. Based on given text as an input, 
we have predicted what would be the category. We have five types of categories corresponding to different makeup products.
In our analysis we used a different methods for a feature extraction (such as Word2vec, Doc2vec) and 
various Machine Learning/Deep Lerning algorithms to get more accurate predictions 
and choose the most accurate one for our issue.


Project contains:
Multi-class text classification with ML algorithms- Text_analysis.ipynb

Text classification with MLP and Convolutional Neural Netwok (CNN) models - Text_nn.ipynb
EDA analysis - Products_analysis.ipynb
LDA - Topic modeling - LDA_Topic_modeling.ipynb
Word2vec model - Word2vec.ipynb
Python scripts to clean data and use text model - clean_data.py, text_model.py
